# Waste Management Behavior Analysis of University Students in Suranaree University of Technology Dormitory

*Project Status:* In Progress (Expected Completion: January 2024)

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the waste management behavior of students residing in the Suranaree University of Technology dormitory. The analysis involves statistical methods using SPSS and data visualization through Power BI. Basic statistical analyses include descriptive statistics, frequency, percentage, independent T-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and advanced statistics using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Future analyses will explore additional statistical metrics to gain deeper insights.

## Objectives
- Conduct descriptive statistics to understand the basic characteristics of waste management behavior.
- Use frequency and percentage analysis to identify common patterns in waste disposal.
- Apply independent T-test to compare waste management practices between different groups.
- Perform one-way ANOVA to analyze variations in waste management behavior across multiple groups.
- Utilize Pearson's correlation coefficient and other advanced statistics for in-depth analysis.
- Extract insights from the analysis to identify problems and root causes.
- Propose solutions based on the identified issues for future waste management improvements.

## Tools Used
- SPSS: Statistical analysis tool for basic and intermediate statistical tests.
- Power BI: Data visualization tool for creating interactive and insightful reports.

## How to Replicate the Analysis
1. Ensure you have SPSS and Power BI installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Import the dataset into SPSS for statistical analysis.
4. Use Power BI to visualize the analyzed data and generate reports.

## Future Work
- Continue the analysis with additional statistical tests for a comprehensive understanding.
- Explore more advanced statistical techniques to uncover hidden patterns.
- Collaborate with stakeholders to implement solutions based on the analysis.
